  "readme": "[Twitter Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)\n=================\n\nBootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.\n\nTo get started, checkout https://getbootstrap.com!\n\n\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\nClone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).\n\n\n\nVersioning\n----------\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit https://semver.org/.\n\n\n\nBug tracker\n-----------\n\nHave a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub that conforms with [necolas's guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines).\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues\n\n\n\nTwitter account\n---------------\n\nKeep up to date on announcements and more by following Bootstrap on Twitter, [@TwBootstrap](https://twitter.com/TwBootstrap).\n\n\n\nBlog\n----\n\nRead more detailed announcements, discussions, and more on [The Official Twitter Bootstrap Blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com).\n\n\n\nMailing list\n------------\n\nHave a question? Ask on our mailing list!\n\ntwitter-bootstrap@googlegroups.com\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/twitter-bootstrap\n\n\n\nIRC\n---\n\nServer: irc.freenode.net\n\nChannel: ##twitter-bootstrap (the double ## is not a typo)\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n\nWe have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.\n\n+ **dependencies**\nOur makefile depends on you having recess, connect, uglify.js, and jshint installed. To install, just run the following command in npm:\n\n```\n$ npm install recess connect uglify-js jshint -g\n```\n\n+ **build** - `make`\nRuns the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires recess and uglify-js. <a href=\"https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#compiling\">Read more in our docs &raquo;</a>\n\n+ **test** - `make test`\nRuns jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](https://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.\n\n+ **watch** - `make watch`\nThis is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.\n\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease submit all pull requests against *-wip branches. If your unit test contains javascript patches or features, you must include relevant unit tests.
