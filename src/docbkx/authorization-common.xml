  <section xml:id="authorities"><info><title>Authorities</title></info>

    <para>As briefly mentioned in the Authentication section, all
    <literal>Authentication</literal> implementations are required to
    store an array of <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> objects. These
    represent the authorities that have been granted to the principal. The
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> objects are inserted into the
    <literal>Authentication</literal> object by the
    <literal>AuthenticationManager</literal> and are later read by
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal>s when making authorization
    decisions.</para>

    <para><literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> is an interface with only
    one method:
      <programlisting>
  String getAuthority();
    </programlisting>
    This method allows <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal>s to
    obtain a precise <literal>String</literal> representation of the
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal>. By returning a representation as
    a <literal>String</literal>, a <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> can
    be easily "read" by most <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal>s. If
    a <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> cannot be precisely represented
    as a <literal>String</literal>, the
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> is considered "complex" and
    <literal>getAuthority()</literal> must return
    <literal>null</literal>.</para>

    <para>An example of a "complex" <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal>
    would be an implementation that stores a list of operations and
    authority thresholds that apply to different customer account numbers.
    Representing this complex <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> as a
    <literal>String</literal> would be quite complex, and as a result the
    <literal>getAuthority()</literal> method should return
    <literal>null</literal>. This will indicate to any
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> that it will need to
    specifically support the <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal>
    implementation in order to understand its contents.</para>

    <para>Spring Security includes one concrete
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> implementation,
    <literal>GrantedAuthorityImpl</literal>. This allows any
    user-specified <literal>String</literal> to be converted into a
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal>. All
    <literal>AuthenticationProvider</literal>s included with the security
    architecture use <literal>GrantedAuthorityImpl</literal> to populate
    the <literal>Authentication</literal> object.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="pre-invocation"><info><title>Pre-Invocation Handling</title></info>
    

    <para>The <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> is called by the
    <literal>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</literal> and is responsible for
    making final access control decisions. The
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> interface contains three
    methods:
      <programlisting>
 void decide(Authentication authentication, Object object, ConfigAttributeDefinition config) throws AccessDeniedException;
 boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);
 boolean supports(Class clazz);
      </programlisting>
    As can be seen from the first method, the
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> is passed via method
    parameters all information that is likely to be of value in assessing
    an authorization decision. In particular, passing the secure
    <literal>Object</literal> enables those arguments contained in the
    actual secure object invocation to be inspected. For example, let's
    assume the secure object was a <literal>MethodInvocation</literal>. It
    would be easy to query the <literal>MethodInvocation</literal> for any
    <literal>Customer</literal> argument, and then implement some sort of
    security logic in the <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> to
    ensure the principal is permitted to operate on that customer.
    Implementations are expected to throw an
    <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal> if access is denied.</para>

    <para>The <literal>supports(ConfigAttribute)</literal> method is
    called by the <literal>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</literal> at
    startup time to determine if the
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> can process the passed
    <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal>. The
    <literal>supports(Class)</literal> method is called by a security
    interceptor implementation to ensure the configured
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> supports the type of secure
    object that the security interceptor will present.</para>

    <para>Whilst users can implement their own
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> to control all aspects of
    authorization, Spring Security includes several
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> implementations that are
    based on voting. Figure 4 illustrates the relevant classes.</para>

        </caption>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>Using this approach, a series of
    <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> implementations are polled on
    an authorization decision. The
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> then decides whether or not
    to throw an <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal> based on its
    assessment of the votes.</para>

    <para>The <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> interface has three
    methods:
<programlisting>
int vote(Authentication authentication, Object object, ConfigAttributeDefinition config);
boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);
boolean supports(Class clazz);
</programlisting>
    Concrete implementations return an <literal>int</literal>, with
    possible values being reflected in the
    <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> static fields
    <literal>ACCESS_ABSTAIN</literal>, <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal>
    and <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal>. A voting implementation will
    return <literal>ACCESS_ABSTAIN</literal> if it has no opinion on an
    authorization decision. If it does have an opinion, it must return
    either <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal> or
    <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal>.</para>

    <para>There are three concrete
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal>s provided with Spring
    Security that tally the votes. The <literal>ConsensusBased</literal>
    implementation will grant or deny access based on the consensus of
    non-abstain votes. Properties are provided to control behavior in the
    event of an equality of votes or if all votes are abstain. The
    <literal>AffirmativeBased</literal> implementation will grant access
    if one or more <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal> votes were received
    (ie a deny vote will be ignored, provided there was at least one grant
    vote). Like the <literal>ConsensusBased</literal> implementation,
    there is a parameter that controls the behavior if all voters abstain.
    The <literal>UnanimousBased</literal> provider expects unanimous
    <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal> votes in order to grant access,
    ignoring abstains. It will deny access if there is any
    <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal> vote. Like the other implementations,
    there is a parameter that controls the behaviour if all voters
    abstain.</para>

    <para>It is possible to implement a custom
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> that tallies votes
    differently. For example, votes from a particular
    <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> might receive additional
    weighting, whilst a deny vote from a particular voter may have a veto
    effect.</para>

    <para>There are two concrete <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal>
    implementations provided with Spring Security. The
    <literal>RoleVoter</literal> class will vote if any ConfigAttribute
    begins with <literal>ROLE_</literal>. It will vote to grant access if
    there is a <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> which returns a
    <literal>String</literal> representation (via the
    <literal>getAuthority()</literal> method) exactly equal to one or more
    <literal>ConfigAttributes</literal> starting with
    <literal>ROLE_</literal>. If there is no exact match of any
    <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> starting with
    <literal>ROLE_</literal>, the <literal>RoleVoter</literal> will vote
    to deny access. If no <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> begins with
    <literal>ROLE_</literal>, the voter will abstain.
    <literal>RoleVoter</literal> is case sensitive on comparisons as well
    as the <literal>ROLE_</literal> prefix.</para>

    <para><literal>BasicAclEntryVoter</literal> is the other concrete
    voter included with Spring Security. It integrates with Spring
    Security's <literal>AclManager</literal> (discussed later). This voter
    is designed to have multiple instances in the same application
    context, such as:
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<bean id="aclContactReadVoter"
    class="org.springframework.security.vote.BasicAclEntryVoter">
  <property name="processConfigAttribute" value="ACL_CONTACT_READ"/>
  <property name="processDomainObjectClass" value="sample.contact.Contact"/>
  <property name="aclManager" ref="aclManager"/>
  <property name="requirePermission">
    <list>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acl.basic.SimpleAclEntry.ADMINISTRATION"/>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acl.basic.SimpleAclEntry.READ"/>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="aclContactDeleteVoter" 
    class="org.springframework.security.vote.BasicAclEntryVoter">
  <property name="processConfigAttribute" value="ACL_CONTACT_DELETE"/>
  <property name="processDomainObjectClass" value="sample.contact.Contact"/>
  <property name="aclManager" ref="aclManager"/>
  <property name="requirePermission">
    <list>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acl.basic.SimpleAclEntry.ADMINISTRATION"/>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acl.basic.SimpleAclEntry.DELETE"/>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
]]></programlisting>
      In the above example, you'd define
    <literal>ACL_CONTACT_READ</literal> or
    <literal>ACL_CONTACT_DELETE</literal> against some methods on a
    <literal>MethodSecurityInterceptor</literal> or
    <literal>AspectJSecurityInterceptor</literal>. When those methods are
    invoked, the above applicable voter defined above would vote to grant
    or deny access. The voter would look at the method invocation to
    locate the first argument of type
    <literal>sample.contact.Contact</literal>, and then pass that
    <literal>Contact</literal> to the <literal>AclManager</literal>. The
    <literal>AclManager</literal> will then return an access control list
    (ACL) that applies to the current <literal>Authentication</literal>.
    Assuming that ACL contains one of the listed
    <literal>requirePermission</literal>s, the voter will vote to grant
    access. If the ACL does not contain one of the permissions defined
    against the voter, the voter will vote to deny access.
    <literal>BasicAclEntryVoter</literal> is an important class as it
    allows you to build truly complex applications with domain object
    security entirely defined in the application context. If you're
    interested in learning more about Spring Security's ACL capabilities
    and how best to apply them, please see the ACL and "After Invocation"
    sections of this reference guide, and the Contacts sample
    application.</para>

    <para>It is also possible to implement a custom
    <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal>. Several examples are provided
    in Spring Security unit tests, including
    <literal>ContactSecurityVoter</literal> and
    <literal>DenyVoter</literal>. The
    <literal>ContactSecurityVoter</literal> abstains from voting decisions
    where a <literal>CONTACT_OWNED_BY_CURRENT_USER</literal>
    <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> is not found. If voting, it queries
    the <literal>MethodInvocation</literal> to extract the owner of the
    <literal>Contact</literal> object that is subject of the method call.
    It votes to grant access if the <literal>Contact</literal> owner
    matches the principal presented in the
    <literal>Authentication</literal> object. It could have just as easily
    compared the <literal>Contact</literal> owner with some
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal> the
    <literal>Authentication</literal> object presented. All of this is
    achieved with relatively few lines of code and demonstrates the
    flexibility of the authorization model.</para>

    <para>TODO: Remove references to the old ACL package when it's
    deprecated, and have all references to the replacement package limited
    to the chapter describing the new ACL implementation.</para>

    <para>Whilst the <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> is called by
    the <literal>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</literal> before proceeding
    with the secure object invocation, some applications need a way of
    modifying the object actually returned by the secure object
    invocation. Whilst you could easily implement your own AOP concern to
    achieve this, Spring Security provides a convenient hook that has
    several concrete implementations that integrate with its ACL
    capabilities.</para>

    <para>Figure 5 illustrates Spring Security's
    <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal> and its concrete
    implementations.</para>

    <para>Like many other parts of Spring Security,
    <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal> has a single concrete
    implementation, <literal>AfterInvocationProviderManager</literal>,
    which polls a list of <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal>s.
    Each <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal> is allowed to modify
    the return object or throw an
    <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal>. Indeed multiple providers
    can modify the object, as the result of the previous provider is
    passed to the next in the list. Let's now consider our ACL-aware
    implementations of <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal>.</para>

    <para>Please be aware that if you're using
    <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal>, you will still need
    configuration attributes that allow the
    <literal>MethodSecurityInterceptor</literal>'s
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> to allow an operation. If
    you're using the typical Spring Security included
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> implementations, having no
    configuration attributes defined for a particular secure method
    invocation will cause each <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> to
    abstain from voting. In turn, if the
    <literal>AccessDecisionManager</literal> property
    "<literal>allowIfAllAbstainDecisions</literal>" is
    <literal>false</literal>, an <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal>
    will be thrown. You may avoid this potential issue by either (i)
    setting "<literal>allowIfAllAbstainDecisions</literal>" to
    <literal>true</literal> (although this is generally not recommended)
    or (ii) simply ensure that there is at least one configuration
    attribute that an <literal>AccessDecisionVoter</literal> will vote to
    grant access for. This latter (recommended) approach is usually
    achieved through a <literal>ROLE_USER</literal> or
    <literal>ROLE_AUTHENTICATED</literal> configuration attribute</para>

      <para>PLEASE NOTE: Acegi Security 1.0.3 contains a preview of a new

    <para><literal>AuthorizeTag</literal> is used to include content if
    the current principal holds certain
    <literal>GrantedAuthority</literal>s.</para>

    <para>The following JSP fragment illustrates how to use the
    <literal>AuthorizeTag</literal>:</para>

    <para><programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<security:authorize ifAllGranted="ROLE_SUPERVISOR">
<td>
<a href="del.htm?id=<c:out value="${contact.id}"/>">Del</a>
</td>
</security:authorize>
]]></programlisting></para>

    <para>This tag would cause the tag's body to be output if the
    principal has been granted ROLE_SUPERVISOR.</para>

    <para>The <literal>security:authorize</literal> tag declares the
    following attributes:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para><literal>ifAllGranted</literal>: All the listed roles must
          be granted for the tag to output its body.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><literal>ifAnyGranted</literal>: Any of the listed roles
          must be granted for the tag to output its body.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><literal>ifNotGranted</literal>: None of the listed roles
          must be granted for the tag to output its body.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>You'll note that in each attribute you can list multiple roles.
    Simply separate the roles using a comma. The
    <literal>authorize</literal> tag ignores whitespace in
    attributes.</para>

    <para>The tag library logically ANDs all of it's parameters together.
    This means that if you combine two or more attributes, all attributes
    must be true for the tag to output it's body. Don't add an
    <literal>ifAllGranted="ROLE_SUPERVISOR"</literal>, followed by an
    <literal>ifNotGranted="ROLE_SUPERVISOR"</literal>, or you'll be
    surprised to never see the tag's body.</para>

    <para>By requiring all attributes to return true, the authorize tag
    allows you to create more complex authorization scenarios. For
    example, you could declare an
    <literal>ifAllGranted="ROLE_SUPERVISOR"</literal> and an
    <literal>ifNotGranted="ROLE_NEWBIE_SUPERVISOR"</literal> in the same
    tag, in order to prevent new supervisors from seeing the tag body.
    However it would no doubt be simpler to use
    <literal>ifAllGranted="ROLE_EXPERIENCED_SUPERVISOR"</literal> rather
    than inserting NOT conditions into your design.</para>

    <para>One last item: the tag verifies the authorizations in a specific
    order: first <literal>ifNotGranted</literal>, then
    <literal>ifAllGranted</literal>, and finally, <literal>if
    AnyGranted</literal>.</para>

    <para><literal>AccessControlListTag</literal> is used to include
    content if the current principal has an ACL to the indicated domain
    object.</para>

    <para>The following JSP fragment illustrates how to use the
    <literal>AccessControlListTag</literal>:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<security:accesscontrollist domainObject="${contact}" hasPermission="8,16">
<td><a href="<c:url value="del.htm"><c:param name="contactId" value="${contact.id}"/></c:url>">Del</a></td>
</security:accesscontrollist>
]]></programlisting>
    This tag would cause the tag's body to be output if the
    principal holds either permission 16 or permission 1 for the "contact"
    domain object. The numbers are actually integers that are used with
    <literal>BasePermission</literal> bit masking. Please refer to the ACL
    section of this reference guide to understand more about the ACL
    capabilities of Spring Security.</para>

    <para><literal>AclTag</literal> is part of the old ACL module and
    should be considered deprecated. For the sake of historical reference,
    works exactly the samae as
    <literal>AccessControlListTag</literal>.</para>
