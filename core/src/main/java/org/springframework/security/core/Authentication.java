/**
 * Represents the token for an authentication request or for an authenticated principal
 * once the request has been processed by the
 * {@link AuthenticationManager#authenticate(Authentication)} method.
 * <p>
 * Once the request has been authenticated, the <tt>Authentication</tt> will usually be
 * stored in a thread-local <tt>SecurityContext</tt> managed by the
 * {@link SecurityContextHolder} by the authentication mechanism which is being used. An
 * explicit authentication can be achieved, without using one of Spring Security's
 * authentication mechanisms, by creating an <tt>Authentication</tt> instance and using
 * the code:
 *
 * <pre>
 * SecurityContext context = SecurityContextHolder.createEmptyContext();
 * context.setAuthentication(anAuthentication);
 * SecurityContextHolder.setContext(context);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that unless the <tt>Authentication</tt> has the <tt>authenticated</tt> property
 * set to <tt>true</tt>, it will still be authenticated by any security interceptor (for
 * method or web invocations) which encounters it.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, the framework transparently takes care of managing the security context
 * and authentication objects for you.
