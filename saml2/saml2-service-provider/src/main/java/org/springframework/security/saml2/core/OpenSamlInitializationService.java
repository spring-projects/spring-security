/**
 * An initialization service for initializing OpenSAML. Each Spring Security
 * OpenSAML-based component invokes the {@link #initialize()} method at static
 * initialization time.
 *
 * {@link #initialize()} is idempotent and may be safely called in custom classes that
 * need OpenSAML to be initialized in order to function correctly. It's recommended that
 * you call this {@link #initialize()} method when using Spring Security and OpenSAML
 * instead of OpenSAML's {@link InitializationService#initialize()}.
 *
 * The primary purpose of {@link #initialize()} is to prepare OpenSAML's
 * {@link XMLObjectProviderRegistry} with some reasonable defaults. Any changes that
 * Spring Security makes to the registry happen in this method.
 *
 * To override those defaults, call {@link #requireInitialize(Consumer)} and change the
 * registry:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 	static {
 *  	OpenSamlInitializationService.requireInitialize((registry) -&gt; {
 *  	 	registry.setParserPool(...);
 *  		registry.getBuilderFactory().registerBuilder(...);
 *  	});
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * {@link #requireInitialize(Consumer)} may only be called once per application.
 *
 * If the application already initialized OpenSAML before
 * {@link #requireInitialize(Consumer)} was called, then the configuration changes will
 * not be applied and an exception will be thrown. The reason for this is to alert you to
 * the fact that there are likely some initialization ordering problems in your
 * application that would otherwise lead to an unpredictable state.
 *
 * If you must change the registry's configuration in multiple places in your application,
 * you are expected to handle the initialization ordering issues yourself instead of
 * trying to call {@link #requireInitialize(Consumer)} multiple times.
