== Proxy Server Configuration

When using a proxy server it is important to ensure that you have configured your application properly.
For example, many applications will have a load balancer that responds to request for https://example.com/ by forwarding the request to an application server at https://192.168.1:8080
Without proper configuration, the application server will not know that the load balancer exists and treat the request as though https://192.168.1:8080 was requested by the client.

To fix this you can use https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239[RFC 7239] to specify that a load balancer is being used.
To make the application aware of this, you need to either configure your application server aware of the X-Forwarded headers.
For example Tomcat uses the https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/RemoteIpValve.html[RemoteIpValve] and Jetty uses https://download.eclipse.org/jetty/stable-9/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.html[ForwardedRequestCustomizer].
Alternatively, Spring 4.3+ users can leverage https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v4.3.3.RELEASE/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/filter/ForwardedHeaderFilter.java[ForwardedHeaderFilter].
