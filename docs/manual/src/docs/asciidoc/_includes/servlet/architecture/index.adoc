[[servlet-filters-review]]
== A Review of ``Filter``s

Spring Security's Servlet support is based on Servlet ``Filter``s, so it is helpful to look at the role of ``Filter``s generally first.
The picture below shows the typical layering of the handlers for a single HTTP request.

.FilterChain
[[servlet-filterchain-figure]]
image::{figures}/filterchain.png[]

The client sends a request to the application, and the container creates a `FilterChain` which contains the ``Filter``s and `Servlet` that should process the `HttpServletRequest` based on the path of the request URI.
At most one `Servlet` can handle a single `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`.
However, more than one `Filter` can be used to:

* Prevent downstream ``Filter``s or the `Servlet` from being invoked.
In this instance the `Filter` will typically write the `HttpServletResponse`.
* Modify the `HttpServletRequest` or `HttpServletResponse` used by the downstream ``Filter``s and `Servlet`

The power of the `Filter` comes from the `FilterChain` that is passed into it.

.`FilterChain` Usage Example
====
[source,java]
----
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
	// do something before the rest of the application
    chain.doFilter(request, response); // invoke the rest of the application
    // do something after the rest of the application
}
----
====

Since a `Filter` only impacts downstream ``Filter``s and the `Servlet`, the order each `Filter` is invoked is extremely important.

[[servlet-delegatingfilterproxy]]
== DelegatingFilterProxy

Spring provides a `Filter` implementation named `DelegatingFilterProxy` that allows bridging between the Servlet container's lifecycle and Spring's `ApplicationContext`.
The Servlet container allows registering ``Filter``s using its own standards, but it is not aware of Spring defined Beans.
`DelegatingFilterProxy` can be registered via standard Servlet container mechanisms, but delegate all the work to a Spring Bean that implements `Filter`.

Here is a picture of how `DelegatingFilterProxy` fits into the <<servlet-filterchain-figure>>.

.DelegatingFilterProxy
[[servlet-delegatingfilterproxy-figure]]
image::{figures}/delegatingfilterproxy.png[]

`DelegatingFilterProxy` looks up __Bean Filter~0~__ from the `ApplicationContext` and then invokes __Bean Filter~0~__.
The pseudo code of `DelegatingFilterProxy` can be seen below.

.`DelegatingFilterProxy` Pseudo Code
====
[source,java,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
	// Lazily get Filter that was registered as a Spring Bean
	// For the example in <<servlet-delegatingfilterproxy-figure>> `delegate` is an instance of __Bean Filter~0~__
	Filter delegate = getFilterBean(someBeanName);
	// delegate work to the Spring Bean
	delegate.doFilter(request, response);
}
----
====

Another benefit of `DelegatingFilterProxy` is that it allows delaying looking `Filter` bean instances.
This is important because the container needs to register the `Filter` instances before the container can startup.
However, Spring typically uses a `ContextLoaderListener` to load the Spring Beans which will not be done until after the `Filter` instances need to be registered.

[[servlet-filterchainproxy]]
== FilterChainProxy

Spring Security's Servlet support is contained within `FilterChainProxy`.
`FilterChainProxy` is a special `Filter` provided by Spring Security that allows delegating to many `Filter` instances through the `SecurityFilterChain` API.
// FIXME: link to SecurityFilterChain
Since `FilterChainProxy` is a Bean, it is typically wrapped in a <<servlet-delegatingfilterproxy>>.

.FilterChainProxy
[[servlet-filterchainproxy-figure]]
image::{figures}/filterchainproxy.png[]

The <<servlet-security-filters,Security Filters>> in `SecurityFilterChain` are typically Beans, but they are registered with `FilterChainProxy` instead of <<servlet-delegatingfilterproxy>>.
`FilterChainProxy` provides a number of advantages to registering directly with the Servlet container or <<servlet-delegatingfilterproxy>>.
First, it provides a starting point for all of Spring Security's Servlet support.
For that reason, if you are attempting to troubleshoot Spring Security's Servlet support, adding a debug point in `FilterChainProxy` is a great place to start.

Second, since `FilterChainProxy` is central to Spring Security usage it can perform tasks that are not viewed as optional.
// FIXME: Add a link to SecurityContext
For example, it clears out the `SecurityContext` to avoid memory leaks.
It also applies Spring Security's <<servlet-httpfirewall,`HttpFirewall`>> to protect applications against certain types of attacks.

In addition, it provides more flexibility in determining when a `SecurityFilterChain` should be invoked.
// FIXME: Add link to SecurityFitlerChain
In a Servlet container, ``Filter``s are invoked based upon the URL alone.
// FIXME: Link to RequestMatcher
However, `FilterChainProxy` can determine invocation based upon anything in the `HttpServletRequest` by leveraging the `RequestMatcher` interface.

In fact, `FilterChainProxy` can be used to determine which `SecurityFilterChain` should be used.
This allows providing a totally separate configuration for different _slices_ if your application.

.Multiple SecurityFilterChain
[[servlet-multi-securityfilterchain-figure]]
image::{figures}/multi-securityfilterchain.png[]

In the <<servlet-multi-securityfilterchain-figure>> Figure `FilterChainProxy` decides which `SecurityFilterChain` should be used.
Only the first `SecurityFilterChain` that matches will be invoked.
If a URL of `/api/messages/` is requested, it will first match on ``SecurityFilterChain~0~``'s pattern of `+/api/**+`, so only `SecurityFilterChain~0~` will be invoked even though it also matches on ``SecurityFilterChain~n~``.
If a URL of `/messages/` is requested, it will not match on ``SecurityFilterChain~0~``'s pattern of `+/api/**+`, so `FilterChainProxy` will continue trying each `SecurityFilterChain`.
Assuming that no other, `SecurityFilterChain` instances match `SecurityFilterChain~n~` will be invoked.
// FIXME add link to pattern matching

Notice that `SecurityFilterChain~0~` has only three security ``Filter``s instances configured.
However, `SecurityFilterChain~n~` has four security ``Filter``s configured.
It is important to note that each `SecurityFilterChain` can be unique and configured in isolation.
In fact, a `SecurityFilterChain` might have zero security ``Filter``s if the application wants Spring Security to ignore certain requests.
// FIXME: add link to configuring multiple `SecurityFilterChain` instances

[[servlet-security-filters]]
== Security Filters

The <<servlet-filters-review,order of ``Filter``>>s matters.
It is typically not necessary to know the ordering of Spring Security's ``Filter``s.
However, there are times that it is beneficial to know the ordering

Below is a comprehensive list of Spring Security Filter ordering:

* ChannelProcessingFilter
* ConcurrentSessionFilter
* WebAsyncManagerIntegrationFilter
* SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
* HeaderWriterFilter
* CorsFilter
* CsrfFilter
* LogoutFilter
* OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter
* Saml2WebSsoAuthenticationRequestFilter
* X509AuthenticationFilter
* AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter
* CasAuthenticationFilter
* OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter
* Saml2WebSsoAuthenticationFilter
* UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
* ConcurrentSessionFilter
* OpenIDAuthenticationFilter
* DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter
* DefaultLogoutPageGeneratingFilter
* DigestAuthenticationFilter
* BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter
* BasicAuthenticationFilter
* RequestCacheAwareFilter
* SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter
* JaasApiIntegrationFilter
* RememberMeAuthenticationFilter
* AnonymousAuthenticationFilter
* OAuth2AuthorizationCodeGrantFilter
* SessionManagementFilter
* ExceptionTranslationFilter
* FilterSecurityInterceptor
* SwitchUserFilter
