= HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
When you type in your bank's website, do you enter mybank.example.com or do you enter https://mybank.example.com[]? If you omit the https protocol, you are potentially vulnerable to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack[Man in the Middle attacks].
Even if the website performs a redirect to https://mybank.example.com a malicious user could intercept the initial HTTP request and manipulate the response (i.e. redirect to https://mibank.example.com and steal their credentials).

Many users omit the https protocol and this is why http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797[HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)] was created.
Once mybank.example.com is added as a http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-5.1[HSTS host], a browser can know ahead of time that any request to mybank.example.com should be interpreted as https://mybank.example.com.
This greatly reduces the possibility of a Man in the Middle attack occurring.

[NOTE]
===
In accordance with http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-7.2[RFC6797], the HSTS header is only injected into HTTPS responses.
In order for the browser to acknowledge the header, the browser must first trust the CA that signed the SSL certificate used to make the connection (not just the SSL certificate).
===

One way for a site to be marked as a HSTS host is to have the host preloaded into the browser.
Another is to add the "Strict-Transport-Security" header to the response.
For example the following would instruct the browser to treat the domain as an HSTS host for a year (there are approximately 31536000 seconds in a year):

[source]
----
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
----

The optional includeSubDomains directive instructs Spring Security that subdomains (i.e. secure.mybank.example.com) should also be treated as an HSTS domain.

As with the other headers, Spring Security adds HSTS by default.
You can customize HSTS headers with the <<nsa-hsts,<hsts>>> element as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- ... -->

	<headers>
		<hsts
			include-subdomains="true"
			max-age-seconds="31536000" />
	</headers>
</http>
----

Similarly, you can enable only HSTS headers with Java Configuration:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
	// ...
	.headers()
		.httpStrictTransportSecurity()
			.includeSubdomains(true)
			.maxAgeSeconds(31536000);
}
}
