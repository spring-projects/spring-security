= CSRF Attacks
Before we discuss how Spring Security can protect applications from CSRF attacks, we will explain what a CSRF attack is.
Let's take a look at a concrete example to get a better understanding.

Assume that your bank's website provides a form that allows transferring money from the currently logged in user to another bank account.
For example, the HTTP request might look like:


[source]
----
POST /transfer HTTP/1.1
Host: bank.example.com
Cookie: JSESSIONID=randomid; Domain=bank.example.com; Secure; HttpOnly
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=100.00&routingNumber=1234&account=9876
----

Now pretend you authenticate to your bank's website and then, without logging out, visit an evil website.
The evil website contains an HTML page with the following form:

[source,xml]
----
<form action="https://bank.example.com/transfer" method="post">
<input type="hidden"
	name="amount"
	value="100.00"/>
<input type="hidden"
	name="routingNumber"
	value="evilsRoutingNumber"/>
<input type="hidden"
	name="account"
	value="evilsAccountNumber"/>
<input type="submit"
	value="Win Money!"/>
</form>
----

You like to win money, so you click on the submit button.
In the process, you have unintentionally transferred $100 to a malicious user.
This happens because, while the evil website cannot see your cookies, the cookies associated with your bank are still sent along with the request.

Worst yet, this whole process could have been automated using JavaScript.
This means you didn't even need to click on the button.
So how do we protect ourselves from such attacks?
