There are a few caveats when implementing CSRF.

// FIXME: I think that log in and log out should possible go into when

[[csrf-timeouts]]
== Timeouts
One issue is that the expected CSRF token is stored in the HttpSession, so as soon as the HttpSession expires your configured `AccessDeniedHandler` will receive a InvalidCsrfTokenException.
If you are using the default `AccessDeniedHandler`, the browser will get an HTTP 403 and display a poor error message.

[NOTE]
====
One might ask why the expected `CsrfToken` isn't stored in a cookie by default.
This is because there are known exploits in which headers (i.e. specify the cookies) can be set by another domain.
This is the same reason Ruby on Rails http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/2/8/csrf-protection-bypass-in-ruby-on-rails/[no longer skips CSRF checks when the header X-Requested-With is present].
See http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2011-February/007533.html[this webappsec.org thread] for details on how to perform the exploit.
Another disadvantage is that by removing the state (i.e. the timeout) you lose the ability to forcibly terminate the token if it is compromised.
====

A simple way to mitigate an active user experiencing a timeout is to have some JavaScript that lets the user know their session is about to expire.
The user can click a button to continue and refresh the session.

Alternatively, specifying a custom `AccessDeniedHandler` allows you to process the `InvalidCsrfTokenException` any way you like.
For an example of how to customize the `AccessDeniedHandler` refer to the provided links for both <<nsa-access-denied-handler,xml>> and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/3.2.0.RC1/config/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/configurers/NamespaceHttpAccessDeniedHandlerTests.groovy#L64[Java configuration].

Finally, the application can be configured to use <<csrf-cookie,CookieCsrfTokenRepository>> which will not expire.
As previously mentioned, this is not as secure as using a session, but in many cases can be good enough.


[[csrf-login]]
== Logging In
In order to protect against http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Forging_login_requests[forging log in requests] the log in form should be protected against CSRF attacks too.
Since the `CsrfToken` is stored in HttpSession, this means an HttpSession will be created as soon as `CsrfToken` token attribute is accessed.
While this sounds bad in a RESTful / stateless architecture the reality is that state is necessary to implement practical security.
Without state, we have nothing we can do if a token is compromised.
Practically speaking, the CSRF token is quite small in size and should have a negligible impact on our architecture.

A common technique to protect the log in form is by using a JavaScript function to obtain a valid CSRF token before the form submission.
By doing this, there is no need to think about session timeouts (discussed in the previous section) because the session is created right before the form submission (assuming that <<csrf-cookie,CookieCsrfTokenRepository>> isn't configured instead), so the user can stay on the login page and submit the username/password when he wants.
In order to achieve this, you can take advantage of the `CsrfTokenArgumentResolver` provided by Spring Security and expose an endpoint like it's described on <<mvc-csrf-resolver,here>>.


[[csrf-logout]]
== Logging Out
Adding CSRF will update the LogoutFilter to only use HTTP POST.
This ensures that log out requires a CSRF token and that a malicious user cannot forcibly log out your users.

One approach is to use a form for log out.
If you really want a link, you can use JavaScript to have the link perform a POST (i.e. maybe on a hidden form).
For browsers with JavaScript that is disabled, you can optionally have the link take the user to a log out confirmation page that will perform the POST.

If you really want to use HTTP GET with logout you can do so, but remember this is generally not recommended.
For example, the following Java Configuration will perform logout with the URL /logout is requested with any HTTP method:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http
			.logout()
				.logoutRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher("/logout"));
	}
}
----

[[csrf-multipart]]
== Multipart (file upload)
There are two options to using CSRF protection with multipart/form-data.
Each option has its tradeoffs.

* <<csrf-multipartfilter,Placing MultipartFilter before Spring Security>>
* <<csrf-include-csrf-token-in-action,Include CSRF token in action>>

[NOTE]
====
Before you integrate Spring Security's CSRF protection with multipart file upload, ensure that you can upload without the CSRF protection first.
More information about using multipart forms with Spring can be found within the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-multipart[17.10 Spring's multipart (file upload) support] section of the Spring reference and the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/support/MultipartFilter.html[MultipartFilter javadoc].
====

[[csrf-multipartfilter]]
=== Placing MultipartFilter before Spring Security
The first option is to ensure that the `MultipartFilter` is specified before the Spring Security filter.
Specifying the `MultipartFilter` before the Spring Security filter means that there is no authorization for invoking the `MultipartFilter` which means anyone can place temporary files on your server.
However, only authorized users will be able to submit a File that is processed by your application.
In general, this is the recommended approach because the temporary file upload should have a negligble impact on most servers.

To ensure `MultipartFilter` is specified before the Spring Security filter with java configuration, users can override beforeSpringSecurityFilterChain as shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class SecurityApplicationInitializer extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer {

	@Override
	protected void beforeSpringSecurityFilterChain(ServletContext servletContext) {
		insertFilters(servletContext, new MultipartFilter());
	}
}
----

To ensure `MultipartFilter` is specified before the Spring Security filter with XML configuration, users can ensure the <filter-mapping> element of the `MultipartFilter` is placed before the springSecurityFilterChain within the web.xml as shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<filter>
	<filter-name>MultipartFilter</filter-name>
	<filter-class>org.springframework.web.multipart.support.MultipartFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter>
	<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
	<filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
	<filter-name>MultipartFilter</filter-name>
	<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
<filter-mapping>
	<filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
	<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
----

[[csrf-include-csrf-token-in-action]]
=== Include CSRF token in action
If allowing unauthorized users to upload temporariy files is not acceptable, an alternative is to place the `MultipartFilter` after the Spring Security filter and include the CSRF as a query parameter in the action attribute of the form.
An example with a jsp is shown below

[source,xml]
----
<form action="./upload?${_csrf.parameterName}=${_csrf.token}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
----

The disadvantage to this approach is that query parameters can be leaked.
More genearlly, it is considered best practice to place sensitive data within the body or headers to ensure it is not leaked.
Additional information can be found in http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html#sec15.1.3[RFC 2616 Section 15.1.3 Encoding Sensitive Information in URI's].

== HiddenHttpMethodFilter
The HiddenHttpMethodFilter should be placed before the Spring Security filter.
In general this is true, but it could have additional implications when protecting against CSRF attacks.

Note that the HiddenHttpMethodFilter only overrides the HTTP method on a POST, so this is actually unlikely to cause any real problems.
However, it is still best practice to ensure it is placed before Spring Security's filters.
