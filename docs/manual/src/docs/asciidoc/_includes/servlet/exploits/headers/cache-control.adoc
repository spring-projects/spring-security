= Cache Control
In the past Spring Security required you to provide your own cache control for your web application.
This seemed reasonable at the time, but browser caches have evolved to include caches for secure connections as well.
This means that a user may view an authenticated page, log out, and then a malicious user can use the browser history to view the cached page.
To help mitigate this Spring Security has added cache control support which will insert the following headers into you response.

[source]
----
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
----

Simply adding the <<nsa-headers,<headers>>> element with no child elements will automatically add Cache Control and quite a few other protections.
However, if you only want cache control, you can enable this feature using Spring Security's XML namespace with the <<nsa-cache-control,<cache-control>>> element and the <<nsa-headers-defaults-disabled,headers@defaults-disabled>> attribute.

[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- ... -->

	<headers defaults-disable="true">
		<cache-control />
	</headers>
</http>
----

Similarly, you can enable only cache control within Java Configuration with the following:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	http
	// ...
	.headers()
		.defaultsDisabled()
		.cacheControl();
}
}
----

If you actually want to cache specific responses, your application can selectively invoke http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setHeader(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)[HttpServletResponse.setHeader(String,String)] to override the header set by Spring Security.
This is useful to ensure things like CSS, JavaScript, and images are properly cached.

When using Spring Web MVC, this is typically done within your configuration.
For example, the following configuration will ensure that the cache headers are set for all of your resources:

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebMvc
public class WebMvcConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

	@Override
	public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
		registry
			.addResourceHandler("/resources/**")
			.addResourceLocations("/resources/")
			.setCachePeriod(31556926);
	}

	// ...
}
