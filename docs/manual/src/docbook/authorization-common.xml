    <para>As we saw in the <link xlink:href="#tech-granted-authority">technical overview</link>, all
        <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> implementations store a list of
        <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> objects. These represent the authorities
      that have been granted to the principal. The <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename>
      objects are inserted into the <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> object by the
        <interfacename>AuthenticationManager</interfacename> and are later read by
        <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>s when making authorization
      decisions.</para>
    <para><interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> is an interface with only one method:
      <programlisting>
  String getAuthority();
    </programlisting> This method allows
        <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>s to obtain a precise
        <literal>String</literal> representation of the
        <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename>. By returning a representation as a
        <literal>String</literal>, a <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> can be easily
        <quote>read</quote> by most <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>s. If a
        <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> cannot be precisely represented as a
        <literal>String</literal>, the <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> is considered
        <quote>complex</quote> and <literal>getAuthority()</literal> must return
        <literal>null</literal>.</para>
    <para>An example of a <quote>complex</quote>
      <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> would be an implementation that stores a list
      of operations and authority thresholds that apply to different customer account numbers.
      Representing this complex <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> as a
        <literal>String</literal> would be quite difficult, and as a result the
        <literal>getAuthority()</literal> method should return <literal>null</literal>. This will
      indicate to any <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> that it will need to
      specifically support the <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> implementation in
      order to understand its contents.</para>
    <para>Spring Security includes one concrete <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename>
      implementation, <literal>GrantedAuthorityImpl</literal>. This allows any user-specified
        <literal>String</literal> to be converted into a
        <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename>. All
        <classname>AuthenticationProvider</classname>s included with the security architecture use
        <literal>GrantedAuthorityImpl</literal> to populate the
        <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> object.</para>

      <title>Pre-Invocation Handling</title>
    </info>
    <para> As we've also seen in the <link xlink:href="#secure-objects">Technical Overview</link>
      chapter, Spring Security provides interceptors which control access to secure objects such as
      method invocations or web requests. A pre-invocation decision on whether the invocation is
      allowed to proceed is made by the <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>. </para>
    <section>
      <title>The AccessDecisionManager</title>
      <para>The <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> is called by the
          <classname>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</classname> and is responsible for making final
        access control decisions. The <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> interface
        contains three methods:
        <programlisting>
 void decide(Authentication authentication, Object secureObject, 
     List&lt;ConfigAttribute&gt; config) throws AccessDeniedException;
 boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);
 boolean supports(Class clazz);
      </programlisting>
        The <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>'s <methodname>decide</methodname>
        method is passed all the relevant information it needs in order to make an authorization
        decision. In particular, passing the secure <literal>Object</literal> enables those
        arguments contained in the actual secure object invocation to be inspected. For example,
        let's assume the secure object was a <classname>MethodInvocation</classname>. It would be
        easy to query the <classname>MethodInvocation</classname> for any
          <literal>Customer</literal> argument, and then implement some sort of security logic in
        the <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> to ensure the principal is
        permitted to operate on that customer. Implementations are expected to throw an
          <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal> if access is denied.</para>
      <para>The <literal>supports(ConfigAttribute)</literal> method is called by the
          <classname>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</classname> at startup time to determine if the
          <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> can process the passed
          <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal>. The <literal>supports(Class)</literal> method is
        called by a security interceptor implementation to ensure the configured
          <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> supports the type of secure object
        that the security interceptor will present.</para>
      <section>
        <title>Voting-Based AccessDecisionManager Implementations</title>
        <para>Whilst users can implement their own
            <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> to control all aspects of
          authorization, Spring Security includes several
            <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> implementations that are based on
          voting. <xref linkend="authz-access-voting"/> illustrates the relevant classes.</para>
        <figure xml:id="authz-access-voting">
          <title>Voting Decision Manager</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        <para>Using this approach, a series of <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename>
          implementations are polled on an authorization decision. The
            <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> then decides whether or not to
          throw an <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal> based on its assessment of the
          votes.</para>
        <para>The <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> interface has three methods:
          <programlisting>
int vote(Authentication authentication, Object object, List&lt;ConfigAttribute&gt; config);
boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);
boolean supports(Class clazz);
</programlisting>
          Concrete implementations return an <literal>int</literal>, with possible values being
          reflected in the <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> static fields
            <literal>ACCESS_ABSTAIN</literal>, <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal> and
            <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal>. A voting implementation will return
            <literal>ACCESS_ABSTAIN</literal> if it has no opinion on an authorization decision. If
          it does have an opinion, it must return either <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal> or
            <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal>.</para>
        <para>There are three concrete <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>s
          provided with Spring Security that tally the votes. The <literal>ConsensusBased</literal>
          implementation will grant or deny access based on the consensus of non-abstain votes.
          Properties are provided to control behavior in the event of an equality of votes or if all
          votes are abstain. The <literal>AffirmativeBased</literal> implementation will grant
          access if one or more <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal> votes were received (i.e. a deny
          vote will be ignored, provided there was at least one grant vote). Like the
            <literal>ConsensusBased</literal> implementation, there is a parameter that controls the
          behavior if all voters abstain. The <literal>UnanimousBased</literal> provider expects
          unanimous <literal>ACCESS_GRANTED</literal> votes in order to grant access, ignoring
          abstains. It will deny access if there is any <literal>ACCESS_DENIED</literal> vote. Like
          the other implementations, there is a parameter that controls the behaviour if all voters
          abstain.</para>
        <para>It is possible to implement a custom
            <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> that tallies votes differently. For
          example, votes from a particular <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> might
          receive additional weighting, whilst a deny vote from a particular voter may have a veto
          effect.</para>
        <section>
          <title><classname>RoleVoter</classname></title>
          <para> The most commonly used <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> provided
            with Spring Security is the simple <classname>RoleVoter</classname>, which treats
            configuration attributes as simple role names and votes to grant access if the user has
            been assigned that role.</para>
          <para>It will vote if any ConfigAttribute begins with the prefix <literal>ROLE_</literal>.
            It will vote to grant access if there is a
              <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> which returns a
              <literal>String</literal> representation (via the <literal>getAuthority()</literal>
            method) exactly equal to one or more <literal>ConfigAttributes</literal> starting with
              <literal>ROLE_</literal>. If there is no exact match of any
              <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> starting with <literal>ROLE_</literal>, the
              <literal>RoleVoter</literal> will vote to deny access. If no
              <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> begins with <literal>ROLE_</literal>, the voter
            will abstain. <literal>RoleVoter</literal> is case sensitive on comparisons as well as
            the <literal>ROLE_</literal> prefix.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
          <title>Custom Voters</title>
          <para>It is also possible to implement a custom
              <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename>. Several examples are provided in
            Spring Security unit tests, including <literal>ContactSecurityVoter</literal> and
              <literal>DenyVoter</literal>. The <literal>ContactSecurityVoter</literal> abstains
            from voting decisions where a <literal>CONTACT_OWNED_BY_CURRENT_USER</literal>
            <literal>ConfigAttribute</literal> is not found. If voting, it queries the
              <classname>MethodInvocation</classname> to extract the owner of the
              <literal>Contact</literal> object that is subject of the method call. It votes to
            grant access if the <literal>Contact</literal> owner matches the principal presented in
            the <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> object. It could have just as easily
            compared the <literal>Contact</literal> owner with some
              <interfacename>GrantedAuthority</interfacename> the
              <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> object presented. All of this is
            achieved with relatively few lines of code and demonstrates the flexibility of the
            authorization model.</para>

      <title>After Invocation Handling</title>
    </info>
    <para>Whilst the <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> is called by the
        <classname>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</classname> before proceeding with the secure object
      invocation, some applications need a way of modifying the object actually returned by the
      secure object invocation. Whilst you could easily implement your own AOP concern to achieve
      this, Spring Security provides a convenient hook that has several concrete implementations
      that integrate with its ACL capabilities.</para>
    <para><xref linkend="authz-after-invocation"/> illustrates Spring Security's
        <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal> and its concrete implementations. <figure

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>
    <para>Like many other parts of Spring Security, <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal> has a
      single concrete implementation, <literal>AfterInvocationProviderManager</literal>, which polls
      a list of <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal>s. Each
        <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal> is allowed to modify the return object or throw
      an <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal>. Indeed multiple providers can modify the object,
      as the result of the previous provider is passed to the next in the list. Let's now consider
      our ACL-aware implementations of <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal>.</para>
    <para>Please be aware that if you're using <literal>AfterInvocationManager</literal>, you will
      still need configuration attributes that allow the
        <classname>MethodSecurityInterceptor</classname>'s
        <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> to allow an operation. If you're using
      the typical Spring Security included <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename>
      implementations, having no configuration attributes defined for a particular secure method
      invocation will cause each <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> to abstain from
      voting. In turn, if the <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> property
        "<literal>allowIfAllAbstainDecisions</literal>" is <literal>false</literal>, an
        <literal>AccessDeniedException</literal> will be thrown. You may avoid this potential issue
      by either (i) setting "<literal>allowIfAllAbstainDecisions</literal>" to
        <literal>true</literal> (although this is generally not recommended) or (ii) simply ensure
      that there is at least one configuration attribute that an
        <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename> will vote to grant access for. This
      latter (recommended) approach is usually achieved through a <literal>ROLE_USER</literal> or
        <literal>ROLE_AUTHENTICATED</literal> configuration attribute.</para>

        <title>ACL-Aware AfterInvocationProviders</title>
      </info>

      <para>A common services layer method we've all written at one stage or another looks like
        this:</para>
      <para>
        <programlisting>public Contact getById(Integer id);</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>Quite often, only principals with permission to read the <literal>Contact</literal>
        should be allowed to obtain it. In this situation the
          <interfacename>AccessDecisionManager</interfacename> approach provided by the
          <classname>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</classname> will not suffice. This is because the
        identity of the <literal>Contact</literal> is all that is available before the secure object
        is invoked. The <classname>AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider</classname> delivers a solution,
        and is configured as follows: <programlisting><![CDATA[
<bean id="afterAclRead"
   class="org.springframework.security.acls.afterinvocation.AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider">
  <constructor-arg ref="aclService"/>
  <constructor-arg>
    <list>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acls.domain.BasePermission.ADMINISTRATION"/>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acls.domain.BasePermission.READ"/>
    </list>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>
]]></programlisting> In the above example, the <literal>Contact</literal> will be retrieved and
        passed to the <classname>AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider</classname>. The provider will
        thrown an <classname>AccessDeniedException</classname> if one of the listed
          <literal>requirePermission</literal>s is not held by the
          <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename>. The
          <classname>AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider</classname> queries the acl service to
        determine the ACL that applies for this domain object to this
          <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename>.</para>
      <para>Similar to the <classname>AclEntryAfterInvocationProvider</classname> is
          <classname>AclEntryAfterInvocationCollectionFilteringProvider</classname>. It is designed
        to remove <literal>Collection</literal> or array elements for which a principal does not
        have access. It never thrown an <classname>AccessDeniedException</classname> - simply
        silently removes the offending elements. The provider is configured as follows: <programlisting><![CDATA[
<bean id="afterAclCollectionRead"
  class="org.springframework.security.acls.afterinvocation.AclEntryAfterInvocationCollectionFilteringProvider">
  <constructor-arg ref="aclService"/>
  <constructor-arg>
    <list>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acls.domain.BasePermission.ADMINISTRATION"/>
      <ref local="org.springframework.security.acls.domain.BasePermission.READ"/>
    </list>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>
]]>    </programlisting> As you can imagine, the returned <literal>Object</literal> must be a
          <literal>Collection</literal> or array for this provider to operate. It will remove any
        element if the <literal>AclManager</literal> indicates the
          <interfacename>Authentication</interfacename> does not hold one of the listed
          <literal>requirePermission</literal>s.</para>

          <literal>AfterInvocationProvider</literal>s.</para>

    <para>The <literal>security:authorize</literal> tag declares the following attributes:</para>

      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

    </para>
    <para>You'll note that in each attribute you can list multiple roles. Simply separate the roles
      using a comma. The <literal>authorize</literal> tag ignores whitespace in attributes.</para>
    <para>The tag library logically ANDs all of it's parameters together. This means that if you

    <para>By requiring all attributes to return true, the authorize tag allows you to create more
      complex authorization scenarios. For example, you could declare an

        <literal>ifNotGranted="ROLE_NEWBIE_SUPERVISOR"</literal> in the same tag, in order to

    <para>One last item: the tag verifies the authorizations in a specific order: first
