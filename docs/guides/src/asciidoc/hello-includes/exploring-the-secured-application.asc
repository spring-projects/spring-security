=== Exploring the secured application

Start the server as we did in <<running-the-{starter-appname}-application>> Now when you visit http://localhost:8080/sample/ you will be prompted with a login page that is automatically generated by Spring Security.

==== Authenticating to the secured application

Try entering an invalid username and password:

* *Username* _invalid_
* *Password* _invalid_

You should see an error message stating that authentication failed. Now try entering a valid username and password:

* *Username* _user_
* *Password* _password_

You should now see the page that we wanted to secure.

NOTE: The reason we can successfully authenticate with *Username* _user_ and *Password* _password_ is because that is what we configured in our <<security-config-java,`SecurityConfig`>>.
