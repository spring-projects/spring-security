                        requirements?</para></question>
                <answer><para> Spring Security provides you with a very flexible framework for your
                        authentication and authorization requirements, but there are many other
                        considerations for building a secure application that are outside its scope.
                        Web applications are vulnerable to all kinds of attacks which you should be
                        familiar with, preferably before you start development so you can design and
                        code with them in mind from the beginning. Check out the <link

                <question><para>Why not just use web.xml security?</para></question>
                <answer><para>Let's assume you're developing an enterprise application based on
                        Spring. There are four security concerns you typically need to address:
                        authentication, web request security, service layer security (i.e. your
                        methods that implement business logic), and domain object instance security
                        (i.e. different domain objects have different permissions). With these
                        typical requirements in mind:
                                        <orderedlist><listitem><para><emphasis>Authentication</emphasis>:
                                    The servlet specification provides an approach to
                                    authentication. However, you will need to configure the
                                    container to perform authentication which typically requires
                                    editing of container-specific "realm" settings. This makes a
                                    non-portable configuration, and if you need to write an actual
                                    Java class to implement the container's authentication
                                    interface, it becomes even more non-portable. With Spring
                                    Security you achieve complete portability - right down to the
                                    WAR level. Also, Spring Security offers a choice of
                                    production-proven authentication providers and mechanisms,
                                    meaning you can switch your authentication approaches at
                                    deployment time. This is particularly valuable for software
                                    vendors writing products that need to work in an unknown target
                                    environment.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Web
                                        request security:</emphasis> The servlet specification
                                    provides an approach to secure your request URIs. However, these
                                    URIs can only be expressed in the servlet specification's own
                                    limited URI path format. Spring Security provides a far more
                                    comprehensive approach. For instance, you can use Ant paths or
                                    regular expressions, you can consider parts of the URI other
                                    than simply the requested page (e.g. you can consider HTTP GET
                                    parameters) and you can implement your own runtime source of
                                    configuration data. This means your web request security can be
                                    dynamically changed during the actual execution of your
                                    webapp.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Service layer
                                        and domain object security:</emphasis> The absence of
                                    support in the servlet specification for services layer security
                                    or domain object instance security represent serious limitations
                                    for multi-tiered applications. Typically developers either
                                    ignore these requirements, or implement security logic within
                                    their MVC controller code (or even worse, inside the views).
                                    There are serious disadvantages with this approach:

                                                  of concerns:</emphasis> Authorization is a
                                                crosscutting concern and should be implemented as
                                                such. MVC controllers or views implementing
                                                authorization code makes it more difficult to test
                                                both the controller and authorization logic, more
                                                difficult to debug, and will often lead to code
                                                duplication.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Support

                                                supported, any authorization code embedded within
                                                the web layer is non-reusable. It should be
                                                considered that Spring remoting exporters only
                                                export service layer beans (not MVC controllers). As
                                                such authorization logic needs to be located in the
                                                services layer to support a multitude of client
                                                types.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Layering
                                                  issues:</emphasis> An MVC controller or view is
                                                simply the incorrect architectural layer to
                                                implement authorization decisions concerning
                                                services layer methods or domain object instances.
                                                Whilst the Principal may be passed to the services
                                                layer to enable it to make the authorization
                                                decision, doing so would introduce an additional
                                                argument on every services layer method. A more
                                                elegant approach is to use a ThreadLocal to hold the
                                                Principal, although this would likely increase
                                                development time to a point where it would become
                                                more economical (on a cost-benefit basis) to simply
                                                use a dedicated security
                                            framework.</para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis>Authorisation

                                                frameworks that they "make it easier to do the right

                                                frameworks are the same, because they are designed
                                                in an abstract manner for a wide range of purposes.

                                                does not provide the "design check" a framework

                <answer><para> Realistically, you need an understanding of the technolgies you are
                        intending to use before you can successfully build applications with them.
                        Security is complicated. Setting up a simple configuration using a login
                        form and some hard-coded users using Spring Security's namespace is
                        reasonably straightforward. Moving to using a backed JDBC database is also
                        easy enough. But if you try and jump straight to a complicated deployment
                        scenario like this you will almost certainly be frustrated. There is a big
                        jump in the learning curve required to set up systems like CAS, configure
                        LDAP servers and install SSL certificates properly. So you need to take
                        things one step at a time. </para><para> From a Spring Security perspective,

                        guide on the web site. This will take you through a series of steps to get
                        up and running and get some idea of how the framework operates. If you are
                        using other technologies which you aren't familiar with then you should do
                        some research and try to make sure you can use them in isolation before
                        combining them in a complex system. </para></answer>

            <para>
                Session management issues are a common source of forum questions. If you are developing Java web applications, you
                should understand how the session is maintained between the servlet container and the user's browser. You should also
                understand the difference between secure and non-secure cookies and the implications of using HTTP/HTTPS and switching
                between the two. Spring Security has nothing to do with maintaining the session or providing session identifiers. This is
                entirely handled by the servlet container.

                    <para>I'm using Spring Security's concurrent session control to prevent users from logging in more than once at a time.
                        When I open another browser window after logging in, it doesn't stop me from logging in again. Why can I log
                        in more than once?
                    </para></question>
                <answer><para>Browsers generally maintain a single session per browser instance. You cannot have two separate
                sessions at once. So if you log in again in another window or tab you are just reauthenticating in the same session.
                The server doesn't know anything about tabs, windows or browser instances. All it sees are HTTP requests and it ties
                those to a particular session according to the value of the the JSESSIONID cookie that they contain.
                When a user authenticates during a session, Spring Security's concurrent session control checks the number of
                <emphasis>other authenticated sessions</emphasis> that they have. If they are already authenticated
                with the same session, then re-authenticating will have no effect.

                        the login page after authenticating. </para></question>
                <answer><para> This happens because sessions created under HTTPS, for which the session cookie is marked as

                            browser will not send the cookie back to the server and any session
                            state will be lost (including the security context information).
                            Starting a session in HTTP first should work as the session cookie won't
                            be marked as secure (you will also have to disable Spring Security's

                            yourself at a later stage). Note that switching between HTTP and HTTPS is not a good idea in general, as any application which uses
                            HTTP at all is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. To be truly secure, the user should begin accessing your site in HTTPS and continue
                            using it until they log out. Even clicking on an HTTPS link from a page accessed over HTTP is potentially risky.

                    <para>Spring Security has a voter-based architecture which means that an access
                        decision is made by a series of <interfacename>AccessDecisionVoter</interfacename>s.
                        The voters act on the <quote>configuration attributes</quote> which are specified for a
                        secured resource (such as a method invocation). With this approach, not all attributes may
                        be relevant to all voters and a voter needs to know when it should ignore an attribute (abstain) and
                        when it should vote to grant or deny access based on the attribute value.
                        The most common voter is the <classname>RoleVoter</classname> which by default votes
                        whenever it finds an attribute with the <quote>ROLE_</quote> prefix. It makes a simple comparison
                        of the attribute (such as <quote>ROLE_USER</quote>) with the names of the authorities which
                        the current user has been assigned. If it finds a match (they have an authority called
                        <quote>ROLE_USER</quote>), it votes to grant access, otherwise it votes to deny access.

                        no need for other custom voters, then you can set the prefix to a blank string, in which case the
                        <classname>RoleVoter</classname> will treat all attributes as roles.

                    sample applications WEB-INF/lib directories. For a basic application, you
                    can start with the tutorial sample. If you want to use LDAP, with an

                        will find more information there by searching the archives (or through
                        google).</para><para> The submitted login information is processed by an
                        instance of <classname>UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter</classname>. You
                        will need to customize this class to handle the extra data field(s). One
                        option is to use your own customized authentication token class (rather than
                        the standard <classname>UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken</classname>),
                        another is simply to concatenate the extra fields with the username (for
                        example, using a ":" as the separator) and pass them in the username
                        property of <classname>UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken</classname>.
                        </para><para> You will also need to customize the actual authentication
                        process. If you are using a custom authentication token class, for example,
                        you will have to write an <classname>AuthenticationProvider</classname> to
                        handle it (or extend the standard
                            <classname>DaoAuthenticationProvider</classname>). If you have
                        concatenated the fields, you can implement your own
                            <interfacename>UserDetailsService</interfacename> which splits them up
                        and loads the appropriate user data for authentication. </para></answer>

                        dynamically?</para></question>
                <answer><para>People often ask about how to store the mapping between secured URLs
                        and security metadata attributes in a database, rather than in the
                        application context. </para><para> The first thing you should ask yourself
                        is if you really need to do this. If an application requires securing, then
                        it also requires that the security be tested thoroughly based on a defined
                        policy. It may require auditing and acceptance testing before being rolled
                        out into a production environment. A security-conscious organization should
                        be aware that the benefits of their diligent testing process could be wiped
                        out instantly by allowing the security settings to be modified at runtime by
                        changing a row or two in a configuration database. If you have taken this
                        into account (perhaps using multiple layers of security within your
                        application) then Spring Security allows you to fully customize the source
                        of security metadata. You can make it fully dynamic if you choose.
                        </para><para> Both method and web security are protected by subclasses of

                        obtains the metadata for a particular method or filter invocation. For web security,
                        the interceptor class is <classname>FilterSecurityInterceptor</classname>
                        and it uses the marker interface
                            <interfacename>FilterInvocationSecurityMetadataSource</interfacename>.
                        The <quote>secured object</quote> type it operates on is a

                        you must be using an explicitly declared security filter chain (typically
                        Spring Security's <classname>FilterChainProxy</classname>) in order to
                        customize the <classname>FilterSecurityInterceptor</classname> bean. You
                        can't use the namespace. You would then implement

                    dependency, you can do this by adding a <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename> to your

                        In order to do this, you need to know a bit about which beans are created, so you should also read the

                        Normally, you would add the functionality you require to the <methodname>postProcessBeforeInitialization</methodname>
                        method of <interfacename>BeanPostProcessor</interfacename>. Let's say that you want to customize the

                        (created by the <literal>form-login</literal> element). You want to extract a particular header called
                        <literal>CUSTOM_HEADER</literal>from the request and make use of it while authenticating the user.
                        The processor class would look like this:

        return bean;
    }

]]></programlisting>
                        You would then register this bean in your application context. Spring will automatically invoke it on the
                        beans defined in the application context.
