The 5.8 migration guide contains several steps for

exploit protection migrations when updating to 6.0.

You are encouraged to follow those steps first.

The following steps relate to how to finish migrating exploit protection support.

== Defer Loading CsrfToken

In Spring Security 5.8, the default `CsrfTokenRequestHandler` for making the `CsrfToken` available to the application is `CsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler`.
The default for the field `csrfRequestAttributeName` is `null`, which causes the CSRF token to be loaded on every request.

In Spring Security 6, `csrfRequestAttributeName` defaults to `_csrf`.
If you configured the following only for the purpose of updating to 6.0, you can now remove it:

    requestHandler.setCsrfRequestAttributeName("_csrf");

== Protect against CSRF BREACH

In Spring Security 5.8, the default `CsrfTokenRequestHandler` for making the `CsrfToken` available to the application is `CsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler`.
`XorCsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler` was added to allow opting into CSRF BREACH support.

In Spring Security 6, `XorCsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler` is the default `CsrfTokenRequestHandler` for making the `CsrfToken` available.
If you configured the `XorCsrfTokenRequestAttributeHandler` only for the purpose of updating to 6.0, you can remove it completely.

[NOTE]
====
If you have set the `csrfRequestAttributeName` to `null` in order to opt out of deferred tokens, or if you have configured a `CsrfTokenRequestHandler` for any other reason, you can leave the configuration in place.
====

== CSRF BREACH with WebSocket support

In Spring Security 5.8, the default `ChannelInterceptor` for making the `CsrfToken` available with xref:servlet/integrations/websocket.adoc[WebSocket Security] is `CsrfChannelInterceptor`.
`XorCsrfChannelInterceptor` was added to allow opting into CSRF BREACH support.

In Spring Security 6, `XorCsrfChannelInterceptor` is the default `ChannelInterceptor` for making the `CsrfToken` available.
If you configured the `XorCsrfChannelInterceptor` only for the purpose of updating to 6.0, you can remove it completely.
