:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The SAML 2.0 Login feature provides an application with the ability to act as a SAML 2.0 relying party, having users https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/FlowsAndConfig[log in] to the application by using their existing account at a SAML 2.0 Asserting Party (Okta, ADFS, and others).

[NOTE]

[[servlet-saml2login-spring-security-history]]
Since 2009, support for relying parties has existed as an https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/tree/1e013b07a7772defd6a26fcfae187c9bf661ee8f#spring-saml[extension project].
In 2019, the process began to port that into https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security[Spring Security] proper.
This process is similar to the one started in 2017 for xref:servlet/oauth2/index.adoc[Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 support].

A working sample for {gh-samples-url}/servlet/spring-boot/java/saml2/login[SAML 2.0 Login] is available in the {gh-samples-url}[Spring Security Samples repository].
