[[servlet-httpfirewall]]
= HttpFirewall
Spring Security has several areas where patterns you have defined are tested against incoming requests to decide how the request should be handled.
This occurs when the `FilterChainProxy` decides which filter chain a request should be passed through and when the `FilterSecurityInterceptor` decides which security constraints apply to a request.
It is important to understand what the mechanism is and what URL value is used when testing against the patterns that you define.

The servlet specification defines several properties for the `HttpServletRequest` that are accessible via getter methods and that we might want to match against.
These are the `contextPath`, `servletPath`, `pathInfo`, and `queryString`.
Spring Security is only interested in securing paths within the application, so the `contextPath` is ignored.
Unfortunately, the servlet spec does not define exactly what the values of `servletPath` and `pathInfo` contain for a particular request URI.
For example, each path segment of a URL may contain parameters, as defined in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt[RFC 2396]
(You have probably seen this when a browser does not support cookies and the `jsessionid` parameter is appended to the URL after a semicolon.
However, the RFC allows the presence of these parameters in any path segment of the URL.)
The Specification does not clearly state whether these should be included in the `servletPath` and `pathInfo` values and the behavior varies between different servlet containers.
There is a danger that, when an application is deployed in a container that does not strip path parameters from these values, an attacker could add them to the requested URL to cause a pattern match to succeed or fail unexpectedly.
(The original values will be returned once the request leaves the `FilterChainProxy`, so will still be available to the application.)
Other variations in the incoming URL are also possible.
For example, it could contain path-traversal sequences (such as `/../`) or multiple forward slashes (`//`) that could also cause pattern-matches to fail.
Some containers normalize these out before performing the servlet mapping, but others do not.
To protect against issues like these, `FilterChainProxy` uses an `HttpFirewall` strategy to check and wrap the request.
By default, un-normalized requests are automatically rejected, and path parameters and duplicate slashes are removed for matching purposes.
(So, for example, an original request path of `/secure;hack=1/somefile.html;hack=2` is returned as `/secure/somefile.html`.)
It is, therefore, essential that a `FilterChainProxy` is used to manage the security filter chain.
Note that the `servletPath` and `pathInfo` values are decoded by the container, so your application should not have any valid paths that contain semi-colons, as these parts are removed for matching purposes.

As mentioned earlier, the default strategy is to use Ant-style paths for matching, and this is likely to be the best choice for most users.
The strategy is implemented in the class `AntPathRequestMatcher`, which uses Spring's `AntPathMatcher` to perform a case-insensitive match of the pattern against the concatenated `servletPath` and `pathInfo`, ignoring the `queryString`.

If you need a more powerful matching strategy, you can use regular expressions.
The strategy implementation is then `RegexRequestMatcher`.
See the {security-api-url}/org/springframework/security/web/util/matcher/RegexRequestMatcher.html[Javadoc for this class] for more information.

In practice, we recommend that you use method security at your service layer, to control access to your application, rather than rely entirely on the use of security constraints defined at the web-application level.
URLs change, and it is difficult to take into account all the possible URLs that an application might support and how requests might be manipulated.
You should restrict yourself to using a few simple Ant paths that are simple to understand.
Always try to use a "`deny-by-default`" approach, where you have a catch-all wildcard (`/**` or `**`) defined last to deny access.

Security defined at the service layer is much more robust and harder to bypass, so you should always take advantage of Spring Security's method security options.

The `HttpFirewall` also prevents https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting[HTTP Response Splitting] by rejecting new line characters in the HTTP Response headers.

By default, the `StrictHttpFirewall` implementation is used.
This implementation rejects requests that appear to be malicious.
If it is too strict for your needs, you can customize what types of requests are rejected.
However, it is important that you do so knowing that this can open your application up to attacks.
For example, if you wish to use Spring MVC's matrix variables, you could use the following configuration:

.Allow Matrix Variables
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public StrictHttpFirewall httpFirewall() {
    StrictHttpFirewall firewall = new StrictHttpFirewall();
    firewall.setAllowSemicolon(true);
    return firewall;
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,role="secondary"]
----
<b:bean id="httpFirewall"
    class="org.springframework.security.web.firewall.StrictHttpFirewall"
    p:allowSemicolon="true"/>

<http-firewall ref="httpFirewall"/>
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun httpFirewall(): StrictHttpFirewall {
    val firewall = StrictHttpFirewall()
    firewall.setAllowSemicolon(true)
    return firewall
}
----

To protect against https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_Site_Tracing[Cross Site Tracing (XST)] and https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_HTTP_Methods_(OTG-CONFIG-006)[HTTP Verb Tampering], the `StrictHttpFirewall` provides an allowed list of valid HTTP methods that are allowed.
The default valid methods are `DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT`.
If your application needs to modify the valid methods, you can configure a custom `StrictHttpFirewall` bean.
The following example allows only HTTP `GET` and `POST` methods:


.Allow Only GET & POST
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public StrictHttpFirewall httpFirewall() {
    StrictHttpFirewall firewall = new StrictHttpFirewall();
    firewall.setAllowedHttpMethods(Arrays.asList("GET", "POST"));
    return firewall;
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,role="secondary"]
----
<b:bean id="httpFirewall"
      class="org.springframework.security.web.firewall.StrictHttpFirewall"
      p:allowedHttpMethods="GET,HEAD"/>

<http-firewall ref="httpFirewall"/>
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun httpFirewall(): StrictHttpFirewall {
    val firewall = StrictHttpFirewall()
    firewall.setAllowedHttpMethods(listOf("GET", "POST"))
    return firewall
}
----
====

[TIP]
====
If you use `new MockHttpServletRequest()`, it currently creates an HTTP method as an empty String (`""`).
This is an invalid HTTP method and is rejected by Spring Security.
You can resolve this by replacing it with `new MockHttpServletRequest("GET", "")`.
See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16851[SPR_16851] for an issue that requests improving this.
====

If you must allow any HTTP method (not recommended), you can use `StrictHttpFirewall.setUnsafeAllowAnyHttpMethod(true)`.
Doing so entirely disables validation of the HTTP method.

[[servlet-httpfirewall-headers-parameters]]

`StrictHttpFirewall` also checks header names and values and parameter names.
It requires that each character have a defined code point and not be a control character.

This requirement can be relaxed or adjusted as necessary by using the following methods:

* `StrictHttpFirewall#setAllowedHeaderNames(Predicate)`
* `StrictHttpFirewall#setAllowedHeaderValues(Predicate)`
* `StrictHttpFirewall#setAllowedParameterNames(Predicate)`

[NOTE]
====
Parameter values can be also controlled with `setAllowedParameterValues(Predicate)`.
====

For example, to switch off this check, you can wire your `StrictHttpFirewall` with `Predicate` instances that always return `true`:

.Allow Any Header Name, Header Value, and Parameter Name
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public StrictHttpFirewall httpFirewall() {
    StrictHttpFirewall firewall = new StrictHttpFirewall();
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderNames((header) -> true);
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues((header) -> true);
    firewall.setAllowedParameterNames((parameter) -> true);
    return firewall;
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun httpFirewall(): StrictHttpFirewall {
    val firewall = StrictHttpFirewall()
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderNames { true }
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues { true }
    firewall.setAllowedParameterNames { true }
    return firewall
}

Alternatively, there might be a specific value that you need to allow.

For example, iPhone Xʀ uses a `User-Agent` that includes a character that is not in the ISO-8859-1 charset.
Due to this fact, some application servers parse this value into two separate characters, the latter being an undefined character.

You can address this with the `setAllowedHeaderValues` method:

.Allow Certain User Agents
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public StrictHttpFirewall httpFirewall() {
    StrictHttpFirewall firewall = new StrictHttpFirewall();
    Pattern allowed = Pattern.compile("[\\p{IsAssigned}&&[^\\p{IsControl}]]*");
    Pattern userAgent = ...;
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues((header) -> allowed.matcher(header).matches() || userAgent.matcher(header).matches());
    return firewall;
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Bean
fun httpFirewall(): StrictHttpFirewall {
    val firewall = StrictHttpFirewall()
    val allowed = Pattern.compile("[\\p{IsAssigned}&&[^\\p{IsControl}]]*")
    val userAgent = Pattern.compile(...)
    firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues { allowed.matcher(it).matches() || userAgent.matcher(it).matches() }
    return firewall
}
----
====

In the case of header values, you may instead consider parsing them as UTF-8 at verification time:

.Parse Headers As UTF-8
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues((header) -> {
    String parsed = new String(header.getBytes(ISO_8859_1), UTF_8);
    return allowed.matcher(parsed).matches();
});
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
firewall.setAllowedHeaderValues {
    val parsed = String(header.getBytes(ISO_8859_1), UTF_8)
    return allowed.matcher(parsed).matches()
}
----
