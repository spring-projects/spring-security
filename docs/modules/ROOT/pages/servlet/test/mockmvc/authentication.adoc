= Running a Test as a User in Spring MVC Test

It is often desirable to run tests as a specific user.
There are two simple ways to populate the user:

* <<test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder-rpp,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor>>
* <<running-as-a-user-in-spring-mvc-test-with-annotations,Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations>>

== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor

You have a number of options to associate a user to the current `HttpServletRequest`.
The following example runs as a user (which does not need to exist) whose username is `user`, whose password is `password`, and whose role is `ROLE_USER`:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user("user")))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/") {
    with(user("user"))
}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The support works by associating the user to the `HttpServletRequest`.
To associate the request to the `SecurityContextHolder`, you need to ensure that the `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` is associated with the `MockMvc` instance.
You can do so in a number of ways:

* Invoking xref:servlet/test/mockmvc/setup.adoc#test-mockmvc-setup[`apply(springSecurity())`]
* Adding Spring Security's `FilterChainProxy` to `MockMvc`
* Manually adding `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` to the `MockMvc` instance may make sense when using `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup`

You can easily make customizations.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "pass", and the roles "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_ADMIN".

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/admin").with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN")))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/admin") {
    with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN"))
}
----
====

If you have a custom `UserDetails` that you would like to use, you can easily specify that as well.
For example, the following will use the specified `UserDetails` (which does not need to exist) to run with a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` that has a principal of the specified `UserDetails`:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user(userDetails)))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/") {
    with(user(userDetails))
}
----
====

You can run as anonymous user using the following:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(anonymous()))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/") {
    with(anonymous())
}
----
====

This is especially useful if you are running with a default user and wish to process a few requests as an anonymous user.

If you want a custom `Authentication` (which does not need to exist) you can do so using the following:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(authentication(authentication)))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/") {
    with(authentication(authentication))
}
----
====

You can even customize the `SecurityContext` using the following:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(securityContext(securityContext)))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc.get("/") {
    with(securityContext(securityContext))
}
----
====

We can also ensure to run as a specific user for every request by using ``MockMvcBuilders``'s default request.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "password", and the role "ROLE_ADMIN":

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
		.webAppContextSetup(context)
		.defaultRequest(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
		.apply(springSecurity())
		.build();
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
    .webAppContextSetup(context)
    .defaultRequest<DefaultMockMvcBuilder>(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
    .apply<DefaultMockMvcBuilder>(springSecurity())
    .build()
----
====

If you find you are using the same user in many of your tests, it is recommended to move the user to a method.
For example, you can specify the following in your own class named `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors`:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
public static RequestPostProcessor rob() {
	return user("rob").roles("ADMIN");
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
fun rob(): RequestPostProcessor {
    return user("rob").roles("ADMIN")
}
----
====

Now you can perform a static import on `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors` and use that within your tests:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
import static sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;

...

mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(rob()))
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
import sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*

//...

mvc.get("/") {
    with(rob())
}
----

== Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations

As an alternative to using a `RequestPostProcessor` to create your user, you can use annotations described in xref:servlet/test/method.adoc[Testing Method Security].
For example, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_USER":

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser
fun requestProtectedUrlWithUser() {
    mvc
        .get("/")
        // ...
}
----
====

Alternatively, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE_ADMIN":

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles = ["ADMIN"])
fun requestProtectedUrlWithUser() {
    mvc
        .get("/")
        // ...
}
----
====
