[[servlet-authentication]]
= Authentication

Spring Security provides comprehensive support for xref:features/authentication/index.adoc#authentication[Authentication].
We start by discussing the overall xref:servlet/authentication/architecture.adoc[Servlet Authentication Architecture].
As you might expect, this section is more abstract describing the architecture without much discussion on how it applies to concrete flows.

If you prefer, you can refer to <<servlet-authentication-mechanisms,Authentication Mechanisms>> for concrete ways in which users can authenticate.
These sections focus on specific ways you may want to authenticate and point back at the architecture sections to describe how the specific flows work.
