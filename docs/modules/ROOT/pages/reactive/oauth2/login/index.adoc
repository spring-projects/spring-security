The OAuth 2.0 Login feature provides an application with the ability to have users log in to the application by using their existing account at an OAuth 2.0 Provider (such as GitHub) or OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider (such as Google).
OAuth 2.0 Login implements the "Login with Google" or "Login with GitHub" use cases.

[NOTE]
====
OAuth 2.0 Login is implemented by using the *Authorization Code Grant*, as specified in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework] and https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[OpenID Connect Core 1.0].
