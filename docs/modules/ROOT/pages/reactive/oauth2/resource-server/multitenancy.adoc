= OAuth 2.0 Resource Server Multi-tenancy

[[webflux-oauth2resourceserver-multitenancy]]
== Multi-tenancy

A resource server is considered multi-tenant when there are multiple strategies for verifying a bearer token, keyed by some tenant identifier.

For example, your resource server can accept bearer tokens from two different authorization servers.
Alternately, your authorization server can represent a multiplicity of issuers.

In each case, two things need to be done and trade-offs are associated with how you choose to do them:

. Resolve the tenant.
. Propagate the tenant.

=== Resolving the Tenant By Claim

One way to differentiate tenants is by the issuer claim. Since the issuer claim accompanies signed JWTs, you can do so with the `JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver`:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver = JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver
    .fromTrustedIssuers("https://idp.example.org/issuerOne", "https://idp.example.org/issuerTwo");

http
    .authorizeExchange((authorize) -> authorize
        .anyExchange().authenticated()
    )
    .oauth2ResourceServer((oauth2) -> oauth2
        .authenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagerResolver)
    );
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
val customAuthenticationManagerResolver = JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver
    .fromTrustedIssuers("https://idp.example.org/issuerOne", "https://idp.example.org/issuerTwo")

return http {
    authorizeExchange {
        authorize(anyExchange, authenticated)
    }
    oauth2ResourceServer {
        authenticationManagerResolver = customAuthenticationManagerResolver
    }
}
----
======

This is nice because the issuer endpoints are loaded lazily.
In fact, the corresponding `JwtReactiveAuthenticationManager` is instantiated only when the first request with the corresponding issuer is sent.
This allows for an application startup that is independent from those authorization servers being up and available.

==== Dynamic Tenants

You may not want to restart the application each time a new tenant is added.
In this case, you can configure the `JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver` with a repository of `ReactiveAuthenticationManager` instances, which you can edit at runtime:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
private Mono<ReactiveAuthenticationManager> addManager(
		Map<String, ReactiveAuthenticationManager> authenticationManagers, String issuer) {

	return Mono.fromCallable(() -> ReactiveJwtDecoders.fromIssuerLocation(issuer))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map(JwtReactiveAuthenticationManager::new)
            .doOnNext((authenticationManager) -> authenticationManager.put(issuer, authenticationManager));
}

// ...

JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver =
        new JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagers::get);

http
    .authorizeExchange((authorize) -> authorize
        .anyExchange().authenticated()
    )
    .oauth2ResourceServer((oauth2) -> oauth2
        .authenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagerResolver)
    );
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
private fun addManager(
        authenticationManagers: MutableMap<String, ReactiveAuthenticationManager>, issuer: String): Mono<JwtReactiveAuthenticationManager> {
    return Mono.fromCallable { ReactiveJwtDecoders.fromIssuerLocation(issuer) }
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map { jwtDecoder: ReactiveJwtDecoder -> JwtReactiveAuthenticationManager(jwtDecoder) }
            .doOnNext { authenticationManager: JwtReactiveAuthenticationManager -> authenticationManagers[issuer] = authenticationManager }
}

// ...

var customAuthenticationManagerResolver = JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagers::get)
return http {
    authorizeExchange {
        authorize(anyExchange, authenticated)
    }
    oauth2ResourceServer {
        authenticationManagerResolver = customAuthenticationManagerResolver
    }
}
----
======

In this case, you construct `JwtIssuerReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver` with a strategy for obtaining the `ReactiveAuthenticationManager` given to the issuer.
This approach lets us add and remove elements from the repository (shown as a `Map` in the preceding snippet) at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
It would be unsafe to simply take any issuer and construct an `ReactiveAuthenticationManager` from it.
The issuer should be one that the code can verify from a trusted source, such as an allowed list of issuers.
