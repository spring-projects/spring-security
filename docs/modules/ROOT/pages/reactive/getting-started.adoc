[[getting-started]]
= Getting Started with WebFlux Applications

This section covers the minimum setup for how to use Spring Security with Spring Boot in a reactive application.

[NOTE]
====
The completed application can be found {gh-samples-url}/reactive/webflux/java/hello-security[in our samples repository].
For your convenience, you can download a minimal Reactive Spring Boot + Spring Security application by https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=example&artifactId=hello-security&name=hello-security&description=Hello%20Security&packageName=example.hello-security&dependencies=webflux,security[clicking here].

[[dependencies]]
== Updating Dependencies

You can add Spring Security to your Spring Boot project by adding `spring-boot-starter-security`.

[tabs]
======
Maven::
+
[source,xml,role="primary"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle::
+
[source,groovy,role="secondary"]
----
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'

[[servlet-hello-starting]]
== Starting Hello Spring Security Boot

You can now https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-running-with-the-maven-plugin[run the Spring Boot application] by using the Maven Plugin's `run` goal.
The following example shows how to do so (and the beginning of the output from doing so):


.Running Spring Boot Application
[tabs]
======
Maven::
+
[source,bash,role="primary"]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
...
INFO 23689 --- [  restartedMain] .s.s.UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration :

$ ./gradlew bootRun
...
INFO 23689 --- [  restartedMain] .s.s.UserDetailsServiceAutoConfiguration :

[[authenticating]]
== Authenticating

You can access the application at http://localhost:8080/ which will redirect the browser to the default log in page. You can provide the default username of `user` with the randomly generated password that is logged to the console. The browser is then taken to the originally requested page.

To log out you can visit http://localhost:8080/logout and then confirming you wish to log out.

[[auto-configuration]]
== Spring Boot Auto Configuration

Spring Boot automatically adds Spring Security which requires all requests be authenticated. It also generates a user with a randomly generated password that is logged to the console which can be used to authenticate using form or basic authentication.
