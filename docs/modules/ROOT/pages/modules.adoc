= Project Modules and Dependencies
In Spring Security 3.0, the codebase was sub-divided into separate jars which more clearly separate different functionality areas and third-party dependencies.
If you use Maven to build your project, these are the modules you should add to your `pom.xml`.
Even if you do not use Maven, we recommend that you consult the `pom.xml` files to get an idea of third-party dependencies and versions.
Another good idea is to examine the libraries that are included in the sample applications.

This section provides a reference of the modules in Spring Security and the additional dependencies that they require in order to function in a running application.
We do not include dependencies that are used only when building or testing Spring Security itself.
Nor do we include transitive dependencies that are required by external dependencies.

The version of Spring required is listed on the project website, so the specific versions are omitted for Spring dependencies in the examples.
Note that some of the dependencies listed as "`optional`" in the examples may still be required for other non-security functionality in a Spring application
Also dependencies listed as "`optional`" may not actually be marked as such in the project's Maven POM files if they are used in most applications.
They are "`optional`" only in the sense that you do not need them unless you use the specified functionality.

Where a module depends on another Spring Security module, the non-optional dependencies of the module it depends on are also assumed to be required and are not listed separately.
