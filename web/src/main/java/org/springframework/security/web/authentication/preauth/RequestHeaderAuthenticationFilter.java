/**
 * A simple pre-authenticated filter which obtains the username from a request header, for
 * use with systems such as CA Siteminder.
 * <p>
 * As with most pre-authenticated scenarios, it is essential that the external
 * authentication system is set up correctly as this filter does no authentication
 * whatsoever. All the protection is assumed to be provided externally and if this filter
 * is included inappropriately in a configuration, it would be possible to assume the
 * identity of a user merely by setting the correct header name. This also means it should
 * not generally be used in combination with other Spring Security authentication
 * mechanisms such as form login, as this would imply there was a means of bypassing the
 * external system which would be risky.
 * <p>
 * The property {@code principalRequestHeader} is the name of the request header that
 * contains the username. It defaults to "SM_USER" for compatibility with Siteminder.
 * <p>
 * If the header is missing from the request, {@code getPreAuthenticatedPrincipal} will
 * throw an exception. You can override this behaviour by setting the
 * {@code exceptionIfHeaderMissing} property.
