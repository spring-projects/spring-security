 * Typically used to ensure the principal is permitted to access the domain object
 * instance returned by a service layer bean. Can also be used to mutate the domain object
 * instance so the principal is only able to access authorised bean properties or

 * database, a transaction manager should be used to ensure any
 * <code>AccessDeniedException</code> will cause a rollback of the changes made by the
 * transaction.
