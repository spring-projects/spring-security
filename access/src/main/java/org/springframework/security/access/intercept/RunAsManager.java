/**
 * Creates a new temporary {@link Authentication} object for the current secure object
 * invocation only.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface permits implementations to replace the <code>Authentication</code>
 * object that applies to the current secure object invocation only. The
 * {@link org.springframework.security.access.intercept.AbstractSecurityInterceptor} will
 * replace the <code>Authentication</code> object held in the
 * {@link org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContext SecurityContext} for
 * the duration of the secure object callback only, returning it to the original
 * <code>Authentication</code> object when the callback ends.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is provided so that systems with two layers of objects can be established. One
 * layer is public facing and has normal secure methods with the granted authorities
 * expected to be held by external callers. The other layer is private, and is only
 * expected to be called by objects within the public facing layer. The objects in this
 * private layer still need security (otherwise they would be public methods) and they
 * also need security in such a manner that prevents them being called directly by
 * external callers. The objects in the private layer would be configured to require
 * granted authorities never granted to external callers. The <code>RunAsManager</code>
 * interface provides a mechanism to elevate security in this manner.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is expected implementations will provide a corresponding concrete
 * <code>Authentication</code> and <code>AuthenticationProvider</code> so that the
 * replacement <code>Authentication</code> object can be authenticated. Some form of
 * security will need to be implemented to ensure the <code>AuthenticationProvider</code>
 * only accepts <code>Authentication</code> objects created by an authorized concrete
 * implementation of <code>RunAsManager</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Ben Alex
 * @deprecated Authentication is now separated from authorization in Spring Security. This
 * class is only used by now-deprecated components. There is not yet an equivalent
 * replacement in Spring Security.
